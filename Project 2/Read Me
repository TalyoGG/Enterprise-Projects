# 🚀 Enterprise Networking Project: Dual-Office Infrastructure with GRE Tunnel Integration 🌐

This project demonstrates the successful design and deployment of a resilient, secure, and scalable enterprise network that connects two office locations—**Headquarters** and **Branch Office**—via a **GRE Tunnel** traversing the public internet. The network emphasizes high availability, secure remote access, and dynamic routing using industry best practices.

## 🔧 Key Implementations

### 🔐 Secure Access & Device Hardening
- Configured routers and switches with secure **hostname conventions**, **encrypted credentials**, and **password policies**.
- Enabled **SSH and Telnet** for secure remote management.
- Applied **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** to permit remote access **only from IT department local hosts** in both offices.

### 🌍 Dynamic Routing & WAN Redundancy
- Deployed **OSPF** with area segmentation:
  - **HQ**: Area 10  
  - **Branch Office**: Area 20  
  - **GRE Tunnel Backbone**: Area 0 (Backbone Area)
- Implemented **floating static routes** to enable WAN failover via a **secondary GRE Tunnel (ISP 2)** for increased reliability and uptime.
- Applied **ACLs on ISP routers** to restrict inbound traffic to only trusted public IPs.

### 🧠 Redundancy & High Availability
- Designed **redundant core and access layer topology** using:
  - **Dual Layer 3 Core Switches**
  - **Dual Access Switches**
- Configured **LACP EtherChannel** between core and access switches to aggregate bandwidth and increase link reliability.
- Enabled **SVIs (Switch Virtual Interfaces)** on core switches for efficient **inter-VLAN routing**.
- Deployed **HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol)** on core switches to ensure **gateway redundancy** in case of core device failure.

### 🔁 Loop Prevention & Traffic Control
- Implemented **Per-VLAN Spanning Tree (PVST)** for loop prevention with:
  - **Core 1** as **Primary Root Bridge**
  - **Core 2** as **Secondary Root Bridge**
- Enforced **port security** on all access ports to prevent unauthorized devices from connecting to the network.

### 🧩 Network Segmentation & Access Policies
- Created **VLANs per department** to segment traffic and improve network organization.
- Applied **ACLs to the Server VLAN** to ensure **only IT department hosts** at both offices can access **Server 1**.
