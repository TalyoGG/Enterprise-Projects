üöÄ Enterprise Networking Project: Dual-Office Infrastructure with GRE Tunnel Integration üåê

Successfully designed and implemented a robust enterprise network connecting two office sites (Headquarters and Branch Office) via a GRE Tunnel traversing the public ISP network. This project focused on maximizing network availability, security, and scalability, aligning with enterprise-grade best practices.

üîß Key Implementations:

Configured router and switch fundamentals, including secure access with encrypted credentials, hostname conventions, and password policies.

Enabled both SSH and Telnet for secure remote device management across all network equipment.

Deployed OSPF routing with area segmentation: HQ: Area 10 Branch Office: Area 20 GRE Tunnel Backbone: Area 0

Implemented floating static routes to support WAN failover through a secondary GRE tunnel (via ISP 2), enhancing WAN redundancy and uptime.

Applied ACLs on ISP routers to strictly permit traffic from public IPs, enhancing perimeter security.

Designed and implemented redundancy of network devices at the core and access layers in both offices (dual Layer 3 core switches + dual access switches).

Configured LACP EtherChannel on links between network devices to improve link reliability and aggregate bandwidth.

Enabled SVIs on core Layer 3 switches for efficient inter-VLAN routing.

Deployed Per-VLAN Spanning Tree (PVST) with: Core 1 as the Primary Root Bridge Core 2 as the Secondary Root Bridge

Configured HSRP on core switches to maintain high availability during switch failure scenarios - increasing availability when Core 1 becomes unavailable

Applied port security on all access ports to prevent unauthorized device access.

Designed and deployed VLAN segmentation per department on access switches.

Enforced access control on the server VLAN, restricting access to Server 1 to only the IT department at both locations.
