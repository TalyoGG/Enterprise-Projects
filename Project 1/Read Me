# üß© Enterprise Network Infrastructure Configuration

This project demonstrates the design and deployment of a secure, scalable, and highly available enterprise network spanning both main and branch office environments. The configuration emphasizes robust access control, encrypted communication, centralized VLAN management, and high availability.

## üîê Security & Access Control

- **Encrypted Device Credentials**  
  - Configured unique hostnames for all network devices.  
  - Encrypted all local credentials (console, VTY, and privileged access) to ensure secure authentication.

- **Secure Remote Access (SSH & Telnet)**  
  - Enabled SSH and Telnet access on all network devices.  
  - Applied ACLs to allow remote sessions **only from IT department local hosts**.

- **IT Department Server Isolation**  
  - Configured **Server 3 (Branch Office)** to be accessible **only by IT department hosts** at both the main and branch offices.

- **ACL for NAT-bound Traffic**  
  - Configured ACLs to **permit only NAT-translated internal addresses** to access external networks, enhancing outbound traffic security.

## üåê Secure Connectivity

- **Site-to-Site VPN via IPsec**  
  - Established a secure **IPsec VPN tunnel** between main and branch office routers to ensure encrypted communication over public networks.

- **NAT Configuration**  
  - Configured **NAT on all edge routers** using ISP-provided public IP addresses to enable secure internet access for internal hosts.

## üîÅ High Availability & Redundancy

- **HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol)**  
  - Configured on **core switches** to ensure default gateway **redundancy and failover protection**.

- **Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)**  
  - **Core Switch 1** set as **Primary Root Bridge** for all VLANs.  
  - **Core Switch 2** configured as **Secondary Root Bridge** for all VLANs to maintain loop-free topology and optimal path selection.

- **PortFast & BPDU Guard**  
  - Enabled on all access ports to accelerate convergence and protect against rogue switch connections.

## üß† Network Management & Scalability

- **VTP (VLAN Trunking Protocol)**  
  - Configured **Core Switch 1** as the **VTP Server**, propagating VLAN configurations automatically across the switching infrastructure.

- **Inter-VLAN Routing**  
  - Enabled on both **main and branch routers**, allowing seamless communication between VLANs within and across office locations.

- **Port Security**  
  - Implemented on all **access layer switch ports** to restrict access to authorized devices and mitigate MAC address spoofing.

## üìå Use Case Summary

This network architecture is ideal for:
- **Secured administrative access**
- **Encrypted site-to-site data exchange**
- **Centralized VLAN and switch management**
- **Failover-ready core switching and routing**
- **Scalable, layered network design**
